# DE0-Billboard-Name
Used four 7-segment displays on a DE0-CV board to show a sliding word like a billboard.

Billboard ABCD was the first file made to test if I can make letters move from one segment display to the next.
Once that was completed I moved on to choosing different names like my name and nicknames.

To do this I first figured out what each letter would be in binary on the segment display than converted it to HEX. Used
counters to time when the word shifts.
